        <p>
            The Minnesota Twins modernized their long-used logo for the 2010 season. The main idea of the logo remained, Twins scripted in red with an underscore highlighting the word WIN on a baseball, a new silver drop shadow added to the wordmark. Also new to this logo was the addition of a navy blue circle around the baseball with MINNESOTA in white arched above and BASEBALL CLUB arched below.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            For the 1987 season, the Minnesota Twins when in a different direction with their logo. Minnie and Paul were replaced with TWINS scripted in red across a baseball, MINNESOTA above in blue. In keeping a link to the past Win-Twins logos, the word WIN in Twins was underlined. Minnesota would win their first two World Series championships with this logo. The shade of navy blue was updated for the 1994 season.</p>

        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1976, the Minnesota Twins updated their original primary logo by considerably darkening the shade of blue used throughout. The main components of the logo remained -- twins Minnie and Paul (representing the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul) shaking hands over the Mississippi River with the state of Minnesota behind them. A new addition to the logo is a club nickname WIN! TWINS! in red above the two twins.</p>
