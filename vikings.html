            Known as The Norseman, the Minnesota Vikings primary logo shows the profile of a viking with long gold, braided hair, a large moustache, and bushy eyebrows wearing a gold and purple helmet with two white horns -- one on either side of the helmet. The Vikings have used this logo in varying colour schemes since their inaugural season. This version here was first used in 2013 and came with several modifications most notably to the horns as well as the overall shape of the logo, especially in the lower left by the hair.</p>
